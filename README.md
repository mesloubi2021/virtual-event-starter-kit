# Virtual Events Starter Kit

This virtual event starter kit was used to run [Next.js Conf 2020](https://nextjs.org/2020/conf), which had almost 40,000 live attendees. It includes the following features:

- Multiple stages - with the ability to add multiple sessions on each stage
- Each stage can be configured as -
  - An embedded YouTube stream OR
  - A live interactive audio-video experience powered by [100ms](https://www.100ms.live)
- Sponsor expo, including individual virtual booths
- Career Fair, allowing attendees to network and find job opportunities
- Ticket registration and generation
- Speaker pages and bios
- Schedule

This platform is built upon three principles:

- **Delegation:** Running a conference is difficult – you have to **delegate** tasks to third-parties to ensure success. Certain elements of an online conference experience are tough to get right, and we'd rather lean on established, industry leading solutions.
- **Flexibility:** While delegating certain elements of the conference experience is helpful, it's also important to own the platform. That's why this template provides a **flexible** open-source codebase that can be modified for your event.
- **Reducing Risk:** It's inevitable something will go wrong during your event. This platform **reduces risk** by leaning on a dynamic site that outputs as static files using [Incremental Static Generation](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching). These static files are cached, ensuring your site is never down. Then, it uses [API Routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) to sprinkle dynamic content on top, which are hosted by a provider with 99.99% uptime.

## What’s New?

The virtual events starter kit now has added support for organising truly LIVE virtual events. You can quickly setup a live stage and invite speakers to interact with viewers. Live audio-video opens up a ton of possibilities with respect to what you can do with this template. You can use it for:

1. Live Webinars
2. Community Calls
3. Hackathons
4. Panel Discussions
5. Multi-stage live conferences with a backstage (coming soon)

## **Clone and Deploy**

Click the button below to clone and deploy this template on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https://github.com/100mslive/virtual-event-starter-kit&project-name=virtual-event-starter-kit&repository-name=virtual-event-starter-kit&demo-url=https://demo.vercel.events&demo-image=https://demo.vercel.events/deploy.png&integration-ids=oac_7yeSwUoVR5no3SlA9WM6oR7l&demo-title=Virtual%20Event%20Starter%20Kit&demo-description=Jumpstart%20your%20virtual%20event%20and%20scale%20to%20any%20size%20with%20Next.js,%20100ms%20and%20DatoCMS)

You’ll be asked to install the **100ms with DatoCMS** integration. It lets you sign up or log in to 100ms and DatoCMS, and connects your DatoCMS and 100ms account to vercel. In a single integration, you will be able to deploy a fully working template that contains all the elements of the virtual events starter kit.

## Running Locally

[![Clone DatoCMS project](https://dashboard.datocms.com/clone/button.svg)](https://dashboard.datocms.com/deploy?repo=datocms%2Fvirtual-event-starter-kit%3Amain)
=======
> **NOTE:** Before this setup make sure to deploy the project using 100ms + DatoCMS integration to speed up the setup process.

After the project is deployed on Vercel, you can find `DATOCMS_READ_ONLY_API_TOKEN` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_HMS_TOKEN_ENDPOINT` already setup in the environment-variables section in project settings. The integration also sets up the [rooms](https://docs.100ms.live/server-side/v2/features/room), [templates & roles](https://docs.100ms.live/server-side/v2/foundation/templates-and-roles) associated with it.
>>>>>>> upstream/main

First, to set local environment variables you can either use Vercel CLI [vercel env pull](https://vercel.com/docs/cli#commands/env) or just manually copy paste them.

```bash

Environment variables determine which CMS to use. See [`lib/cms-api.ts`](lib/cms-api.ts) for details and `.env.local.example` for all environment variables. The demo ([demo.vercel.events](https://demo.vercel.events)) uses DatoCMS.
### Constants
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

Then install the package and run the development server:

```bash
yarn install
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) to see the landing page.

### Stages

There are four different stages included in the seed data. Feel free to add or remove these based on your schedule. Each stage can be easily configured to be a Live Video/Audio experience or an embedded YouTube stream. (You can do all of these configurations via DatoCMS console)

### Joining a stage

Visit `/stage/a` after entering your email you should see a "Enter your name" input form.

> NOTE: by default, you will join as a Viewer

![join](/media/join.png)

Click on Join and you should see "No Speakers Present". This is because only you have joined the Stage aka the "Room" as a viewer. A viewer does not have the permission to publish their audio and video. You can read more about roles in the sections below.

![stage.png](/media/stage.png)

### Joining with different Roles

For this we pass a query param in url for eg: `/stage/a?role=<ROLE_NAME>`

- Moderator: `/stage/a?role=backstage`

- Speaker: `/stage/a?role=stage`

- Viewer: `/stage/a`

So if you visit `/stage/a?role=stage` now you should see a Preview screen opening up. After joining you should be able to see yourselves. Open a new tab or invite others to host your next meetup, community calls, etc.

![preview](/media/preview.png)

### Customize

#### Live Video

To learn more on how to customise the live video aspect of this template, refer to [this document](/hms.md).

### **Constants**

`lib/constants.ts` contains a list of variables you should customize.

Note - In case you're looking to add live audio-video to the events template, we'd recommend you to move ahead with DatoCMS for a seamless integration experience. We've created a dato + 100ms integration that will help you to integrate both 100ms and DatoCMS to your vercel account in a few clicks.

## **Authentication and Database**

Some features won’t work until you set up authentication and database. The demo ([demo.vercel.events](https://demo.vercel.events/)) uses [GitHub OAuth](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/developers/apps/creating-an-oauth-app) for authentication and [Redis](https://redis.io/) for database. You can use different providers as you see fit.

### **Authentication**

You need to have GitHub OAuth set up to be able to customize the ticket after signing up on the registration form.

First, create a [GitHub OAuth application](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/developers/apps/creating-an-oauth-app) to use for authentication.

- Set **Authorization Callback URL** as `<your domain>/api/github-oauth`
- After creating the OAuth app, create a **client secret**.

### **Running Locally:**

- Set the Authorization Callback URL as `http://localhost:3000/api/github-oauth` on GitHub.
- On `.env.local`, set `NEXT_PUBLIC_GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` as the **Client ID** of the OAuth app.
- Set `GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` as the **Client secret** of the OAuth app.
- Finally, make sure the `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_ORIGIN` environment variable is set as `http://localhost:3000`. This is required to get the OAuth popup to work locally.
- Restart the app (`yarn dev`) after editing `.env.local`.

Once it’s set up, sign up using the registration form on the home page (not on a stage page) and then click "Generate with GitHub".

### **On Vercel:**

- Set the Authorization Callback URL as `<your deployment’s URL>/api/github-oauth` on GitHub.
- Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` and `GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` on [Vercel Project Environment Variables Settings](https://vercel.com/docs/environment-variables) for the production environment.
- Edit `SITE_URL` in `lib/constants.ts` to match your deployment’s URL (no trailing slash).
- Push the code to redeploy the Project on Vercel.

### **Database**

You need a database to save user data and enable the following features:

- Generating a unique ticket number for each email when signing up on the registration form. If no DB is set up, it’ll always be `1234`.
- Generating a unique ticket image or ticket URL after signing in with GitHub. If no DB is set up, each ticket image or URL will show generic data.

Environment variables determine which database to use. See [lib/db-api.ts](https://github.com/vercel/virtual-event-starter-kit/blob/main/lib/db-api.ts) for details and `.env.local.example` for all environment variables. There's support for:

- [Redis](https://github.com/vercel/virtual-event-starter-kit/blob/main/lib/db-providers/README.md#redis)
- [Supabase](https://github.com/vercel/virtual-event-starter-kit/blob/main/lib/db-providers/README.md#supabase)
